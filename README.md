# LorentzVectors.jl

This package defines the `LorentzVector{T}` and `SpatialVector{T}` types for use in computations involving Special Relativity.
It implements the usual algebraic operations as well as some relevant functions such as `boost`.
The signature of the Minkowski metric (used for the dot product) is `+,-,-,-`.
